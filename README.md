# 👋 Hi, I'm Dexter

### Data Analyst transitioning from Mechanical/R&D Engineering  
**Python • SQL • Machine Learning • Statistical Modeling • Data Visualization**

I'm an engineer turning my analytical background toward data science.  
I spent 5+ years developing and validating high-reliability medical and industrial systems, where I worked heavily with data — statistical modeling, DOE, root-cause analysis, and process optimization.  

Now I'm focused on building end-to-end data projects using modern tools:
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery)**
- **Power BI / Tableau**
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling**
- **Data Cleaning • EDA • Experimentation • A/B testing**
- **Analytics Engineering fundamentals**

Currently pursuing an **M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Tech** to deepen my knowledge in machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
